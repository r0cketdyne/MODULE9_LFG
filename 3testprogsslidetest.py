#I'm going to write solutions for like three of the
#practice problems at the same python file
#and just comment them out if they won't be run,
#if I need to test them I'll just make sure
#they're uncommended
#actually I need to go to a Physics talk at McGill.
#mostly because I myself am giving a talk next week
#and need to prep; will study the format
#and presentation style.
#will be back at this soon.
